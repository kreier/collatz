The Collatz Conjecture 3x + 1

Some work with python to find and visualize some paths of the Collatz Conjecture 3x + 1. Inspired by the Veritasium video [The Simplest Math Problem No One Can Solve - Collatz Conjecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=094y1Z2wpJg).

## Python code

Just print the number, highest number and steps to 1.

``` py
# to be finished

for i in range(10):
  print(i)
  x = i
  steps = 1
  max = x
  while x != 1: 
  if odd(x):
    x = 3x + 1
```

To be finished.
